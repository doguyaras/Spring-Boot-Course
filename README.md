 Spring Boot Course

In my projects, I have endeavored to apply various techniques I learned during the Spring Boot course.

Technologies I used:

- Spring Core
- Hibernate-JPA CRUD
- REST API CRUD
- REST Security
- JPA Advanced Mappings:
   - One-to-One - Uni-directional / Bi-directional
   - One-to-Many - Uni-directional / Bi-directional
   - Many-to-Many
